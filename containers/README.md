Cadfael Containers
==================
Experimental repository for containerizing build and integration
testing of Cadfael and then SuperNEMO software.

Aim is not for distributing software as a container, rather as an
easy to setup multiplatform testing and validation.

Currently only using Docker, but other ideas should be explored (Rocket,
isolated glibc envs on Linux).
